To use Hush, just launch the application. 

You should see a "hush" status bar item appear in your status bar.

Now go to [hulu.com](http://hulu.com) in your web browser of choice. We use
Google Chrome.

When a commercial comes on, Hush will mute your computer's audio. You'll see
the status bar icon turn from gray to green and red.

When the commercials are finished and the show resumes, Hush will automatically
unmute your audio. The status bar icon will return to a gray color.

That's all there is to it. Just quit the Hush app when you're not watching Hulu
videos or when you're in the mood to hear the Hulu ads.

If Hush stops working one day, please check our website for an update. We'll try to keep Hush working as Hulu makes updates to their ad-serving system. 

Enjoy!
