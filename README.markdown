Hush mutes your computer automatically when Hulu commercials come on.

## Prerequisites

* OS X Snow Leopard 
* It doesn't work on Lion yet, but we're going to work on it

## Download

Download the current version of Hush here: 

* [hush-1.1.zip](https://github.com/downloads/danchoi/hush/hush-1.1.zip)

Unzip the zip archive, and copy the app to your Applications folder. Double-click it to launch.

Hush is free and [open source](https://github.com/danchoi/hush)!

## How to use it

To use Hush, just launch the application. 

You should see a "hush" status bar item appear in your status bar.

Now go to [hulu.com](http://hulu.com) in your web browser of choice. We use
Google Chrome.

When a commercial comes on, Hush will mute your computer's audio. You'll see
the status bar icon turn from gray to green and red.

When the commercials are finished and the show resumes, Hush will automatically
unmute your audio. The status bar icon will return to a gray color.

That's all there is to it. Just quit the Hush app when you're not watching Hulu
videos or when you're in the mood to hear the Hulu ads.

If Hush stops working one day, please check our website for an update. We'll
try to keep Hush working as Hulu makes updates to their ad-serving system. 

Enjoy!

If you use Netflix, please check out
[instantwatcher.com](http://instantwatcher.com). We made that too.

## Hulu Desktop users

Hush apparently doesn't work for Hulu Desktop. We'll look into it and see
if we can make a future update work.
